The HTML file outlines an e-commerce platform with a minimalist structure, displaying a list of products users can browse through and add to their cart.
The header section features a welcoming message, while the body contains two main parts: the product listing and the shopping cart.
Each product is shown with an image, name, rating, price, and an "Add to Cart" button for user interaction.
The shopping cart in the second part of the main section summarizes selected products, their quantities, and offers buttons to modify the quantity or remove items.
The layout uses a flexible design with the help of CSS, featuring elements like flexbox for even spacing of items and alignment of content.
The CSS file imports the Montserrat font family from Google Fonts and applies it across the webpage, ensuring a modern and consistent appearance.
Styling choices like background colors, padding, and rounded corners create a clean and user-friendly interface for product display and cart management.
The cart section includes a detailed breakdown of price components like total price, discounts, platform fees, and shipping charges, culminating in a total amount.
The HTML uses external styling linked via the style.css file, which applies consistent formatting to elements like headers, product images, buttons, and cart items.
The code also includes placeholders for future functionality, such as the JavaScript code (not yet implemented) to enhance interactivity for dynamic behaviors like adding and removing items from the cart​(style)​(INDEX).
